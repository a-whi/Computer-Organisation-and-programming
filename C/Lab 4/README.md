**LAB 4**

Part 1: Recursion

Implement a recursive function in C (file: collatz.c) that performs the Collatz conjecture sequence starting from a given positive integer. 
The function must call itself for each next step in the sequence until it reaches 1.

Part 2: Linked List

Create a linked list-based electronic components database in C (file: component_database.c). Each component has a name, value, unit, 
quantity, and price. Implement functions to insert, remove, search, print, and export components. Implement a terminal-based menu system 
to perform these functions.

Part 3: Test cases

Write test cases for the above programs in a bash script (file: run_tests.sh) which compiles the programs, executes them, and uses a 
provided Python script to validate the outputs.
