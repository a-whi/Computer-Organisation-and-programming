This is all the C code that I wrote throughout the semester.
The labs were done weekly, getting more complex as each week went on. All labs have multiple parts to them.
Lab 4 & lab 5 are the the same problem using different implementations, linked list (lab 4) and binary tree (lab 5).

The assigment was an image based task, figuring out what images are the same based of their pixel mean/varience values. Also worked for images that were flipped and mirrored.

The practise folder was just a folder I used to practise for the exam doing different problems, its a bit of a mess and code in it isn't 100% complete/working.
