**LAB 3**

Part 1: Structs

This part revolves around creating a music record analyzer program in C that uses a struct to store song information from a file. 
You'll define a struct to hold data related to a song and write a program that reads song information from a file into an array of 
these structs.

Part 2: Arrays and Memory Allocation

This part is about manipulating 2D arrays in memory. You'll decode a series of numbers from a file that represent a 2D array. You 
will dynamically allocate memory for the array and then read its borders in anti-clockwise order to discover a secret password.

Part 3: Writing your own Test Cases

This part is about writing your own test cases for your programs. This task tests your understanding of the bash scripting 
language and your ability to validate your own programs.
