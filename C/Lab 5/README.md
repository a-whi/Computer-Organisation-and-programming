**LAB 5**

Part 1:
- 1.1 Simple Bubble Sort:
You are to write a C program (simple_bubble_sort.c) that sorts a 1D array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
The array elements are provided through a text file passed as a command line argument.
Print the sorted array to the terminal.
- 1.2 Two-dimensional Sorting:
Write another C program (complex_bubble_sort.c) that sorts a 2D array row-wise using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
The array elements and their dimensions are provided through a text file passed as a command line argument.
Print the sorted 2D array to the terminal.

Part 2:
Binary Search Trees:
2.1 Binary Search Tree Nodes:
- Create a binary search tree data structure (binary_search_database.c) that holds electronic components information.
2.2 Binary Search Tree Functionality:
- Write functions for different operations like insert, remove, search, print, and export components.
2.3 Implementing the System Menu:
- Implement a menu system for the user to interact with the database. The menu should provide options for the operations mentioned in 2.2.

Part 3:
Test Cases:
- Write a bash script (run_tests.sh) that runs test cases for all the programs you've written in the lab.
The script should include at least three unique test cases for each program.
You should provide necessary comments explaining how each test case is unique.
