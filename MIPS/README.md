This is all the MIPS code that I wrote throughout the semester. The labs were done weekly, getting more complex as each week went on. 
All labs have multiple parts to them. Lab 8 covered implementing a stack.

The MIDSEM_EXAM folder is where my exam code was.

The practise folder was just a folder I used to practise for the exam doing different problems, its a bit of a mess.
