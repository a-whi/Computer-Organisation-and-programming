**LAB 7**

Part 1: Write and debug a simple addition program in MIPS assembly using the MARS IDE. Save it as add_sub.asm and correct any errors.

In a new file, mem_acc.asm, correct errors and explore memory access operations including loading and storing of word, halfword, and byte.
Track changes in registers, program counter, and memory values.

Part 2: In mult_add.asm, complete the multiplication via successive addition of two numbers. Use registers $t0 and $t1 for the numbers, 
and store the result in $s0. The program should end in an infinite loop.

Part 3: In bitwise.asm, create a program to perform specific bitwise operations on an 8-bit value read from memory location 0x10010000, 
and store the modified byte to memory location 0x10010005. The program should end in an infinite loop.
